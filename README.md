[kind reminder: work in progress, some things written down here are actually not there yet]

A field for snowball fights. 

Hi Folks! This very bare framework is for AI competitions in Snowball fighting!
There is a JSON in- and output for each unit. 

INPUT:
    angle, speed, throw_snowball.
    example: NOT HERE YET

angle [INT]: max +3 degrees a call (at 60 hz = 180 degrees a second)
speed [INT]: max +6, negative numbers not accepted.
throw_snowball[BOOL]: only works if "can throw" == True


OUTPUT:
    position, angle, can_throw, eye_sight
    example: {"position": [586.0, 100.0], "angle": 90, "eye_sight": [["unit", 420, 170]], "can_throw": false}  
  
The end goal: win snowball fight! 

I'm looking for people who want to write with me, it's kinda fun.
Also, looking for someone who is good with artwork.
Last, who wanna play some snowball fight?!

Game on!
